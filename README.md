## Getting Started Locally

If you'd like to run the website locally for development or testing, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Zola Static Site Generator (SSG)](https://getzola.org/) installed on your system.

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the repository using either SSH or HTTPS, depending on your GitHub connection setup. Use one of the following commands:

```bash
# Clone with SSH
git clone --recursive git@github.com:rustdelhi/rustdelhi.github.io.git

# Clone with HTTPS
git clone --recursive https://github.com/rustdelhi/rustdelhi.github.io.git
```

### Navigate to the Project Directory

Change your working directory to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd rustdelhi.github.io
```

### Start the Local Server

Now, you can use Zola to serve the website locally. Run the following command:

```bash
zola serve
```

### Access the Local Website

Once the server is up and running, open your favorite web browser and navigate to:

[http://127.0.0.1:1111](http://127.0.0.1:1111)
